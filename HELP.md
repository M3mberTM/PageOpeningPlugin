# Plugin guide

Are you struggling with the Plugin? No worries. I tried to make it as intuitive as possible, but it is understandable
that some might struggle. Below should be a comprehensible guide on how to use the plugin to do what you want!

## Plugin Categories

The plugin is divided into 3 panels.

- Folder and file selection
- Naming
- Switching between pages

> [!NOTE]
> For the purpose of this help document, the categories are going to be a bit different! Read more about each of
> them below!.

### Opening files

The page opening is pretty simple. To open the page that you want to start at, make your way to the first panel:
**Import and Export**. On the top, the plugin will ask you to select a "Start File". Upon clicking the button, a file
dialog opens for you to pick out a file. This file will automatically open upon selection. At the same time, the path to
the file will be displayed just above the button.

### Naming of files

The second panel of the plugin: **Export naming** is all about naming. The naming is divided into two main parts. One is
the input type, where you give information for the file saving. You are obligated to put the Series Name and the Chapter
Number and select the file extension that you want to save your file with. There are other inputs for stuff such as
the Volume number and something to exchange the spaces in the final name with. This concludes section 1.

Section two is only visible if the "**Input leading zeros**" is checked. Upon checking this, you get 3 more sections,
each of them for adding zeros to either volume, chapter or page number. After checking each of them, you are presented
with another input, this time for the number of leading zeros. Only the checked parts will actually form the final name.

I suggest using the "**Update Page Info**" button on the last panel: "**Opening Pages**". This will give you info, such
as the page name, as well as the current page number.

***Example inputs with the result***
> Inputs: Game of Thunder, Volume: 3, Chapter 4, Page: 2, Spaces: _, Leading Chapter: 1, Leading Page: 2

> GoT_Vol.3_Chap.04_002

### Switching between pages

The folder from where you get your pages is selected automatically upon you opening the first page. To go to the
next/previous page, navigate to the last panel: "**Opening pages**". On this panel, click either next or previous to get
the next/previous page.

### File exporting

The exporting of the files comes down to two panels: first and third. First, you need to select your export folder where
you want all your files to end up. To access this feature, you need to click the checkbox on the Export part of the
first panel. Afterward, you need to put some of the required information on the second panel in order for the plugin to
actually export your files. The file is automatically exported upon opening the next or previous page.

## Troubleshooting

Do you have some problem that you can't seem to fix? If you have a GitHub account, post your issue in the "Issues"
category. If you don't, I prepared a Google Forms link for you: [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/vFsgWuz1tSaNtiuK6)

This also a form for suggestions for what to add in the future versions of the plugin.
