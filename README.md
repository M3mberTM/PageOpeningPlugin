# Page opening plugin

Purpose of this plugin is to help especially people in Scanlation. There should be no need to switch between tabs when
you are in the flow. This plugin should allow the user to switch between pages easily and also allow for easy export of
files.

## Is this something for you?

As a person who has spent tons of time in Scanlation, mostly redrawing and typesetting, I became more frustrated with
the export of files. Naming hundreds of files in a specific matter without having to make an application for the
renaming is a big issue on my part, as well as some others.

Now, this plugin should allow you to easily name the files right upon closing them. It should also allow you to work
without a stop as you don't need to tab out to get 20 files opened at once. This plugin will load the files for you, one
by one. Therefore, you only have one file opened at once.

## Installation

Make your way to the releases on the GitHub page. You will see the current version of the plugin release. Steps:

1. Download the .ccx file
2. Unzip the file (preferably using 7zip)
3. Find where your photoshop is located on your PC (usually in C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop\Plug-ins)
4. Open the plugin folder
5. Paste the unzipped folder in
6. Restart photoshop

## Suggestions

If you want to suggest something to add/change/remove, make your way to the issues page for the project and make a new
issue. As far as the time to wait for a reply, it should be within a week. Some of the suggestions might get
implemented, based on how useful they are. In case you don't have an account, and you don't want to make one just for the
sake of showing a problem, I have also decided to make a Google Forms where you can submit your problems. This time
though, I will reply to you on Discord (hence why you need to have DMS open and why there is a question for you discord
username).

Now, if you get lucky and some of your features gets introduced into the plugin, you will also be mentioned in the
Credits for those features (Your name is mentioned as well as the suggestion).
